/**
 * lens_diagnostics tool — cached project diagnostic state (issue #159).
 *
 * Three modes:
 *   delta (default) — fixable warnings from the current agent turn, read from
 *                     the actionable-warnings and code-quality-warnings caches.
 *   all             — all known diagnostic counts across every file pi-lens has
 *                     seen this session, read from the widget state.
 *   full            — active project-wide LSP diagnostic scan merged with all.
