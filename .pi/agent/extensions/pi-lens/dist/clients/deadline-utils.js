/**
 * One implementation of the "race a promise against a timer" pattern that had
 * drifted into three near-identical copies (#366): `withTimeout` (clients/lsp),
 * `withBudget` (read-expansion), and `withinRemaining` (module-report-lsp).
 *
 * The differences between them were real — timeout can *reject* or *resolve
 * undefined*, and the raced promise's own rejection can *propagate* or be
 * *swallowed* — so they are kept as named adapters over one core. Consolidating
 * fixes two latent bugs the copies had: `withBudget` did not suppress the loser
 * promise's late rejection (an unhandled rejection if the timer won first), and
 * `withinRemaining` never cleared its timer.
 */
/**
 * Combine multiple abort signals into one that aborts when ANY of them does.
 * Returns the single signal unchanged when only one is live, and `undefined`
 * when none are — so callers can pass it straight through. Used so a tool honors
 * both its tool-call `signal` positional and the turn-wired `ctx.signal` (Escape),
 * and to fold in a wall-clock ceiling via `AbortSignal.timeout`.
