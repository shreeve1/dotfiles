/**
 * Terminal-safe diagnostic sink for the in-pi extension path (#1333).
 *
 * pi owns the terminal: it runs the TTY in raw mode and repaints with
 * cursor-addressed diffs, so ANY byte an extension writes to stdout/stderr
 * lands mid-frame and desyncs pi's model of the screen — the layout stays
 * broken until a full repaint. `clients/`, `tools/`, `index.ts` and `i18n.ts`
 * are all reachable from the extension entry, so none of them may call
 * `console.*` or `process.std*.write`. (`mcp/`, `scripts/` and `bin/` DO own
 * their stdout contract and keep their writes.)
 *
 * This module is the general-purpose replacement sink: one `createNdjsonLogger`
 * instance over `<global pi-lens dir>/extension.log`, per the single-writer
 * invariant in AGENTS.md. Subsystems that already own a log (tree-sitter,
 * review-graph, cascade, latency, sessionstart) route to THAT log instead —
 * this file is for the areas that had no sink at all.
 *
 * Three-channels rule (#482/#484/#485): everything written here is
 * LOG-audience. A genuinely user-facing degradation must ALSO reach the human
 * through the host's own render path (`ctx.ui.notify` / a display-only session
 * entry) — never a raw write.
