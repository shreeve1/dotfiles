/**
 * Prompt-cache observability (#1018).
 *
 * Two provider-independent signals, both sinking into ~/.pi-lens/latency.log
 * via {@link logLatency} (matching the neighboring `type: "phase"` records):
 *
 *   1. Response-side cache usage (`cache_usage`) — on each assistant
 *      `message_end`, record the provider-reported token/cost breakdown so a
 *      session's actual cacheRead/cacheWrite behavior is queryable after the
 *      fact. This is what the provider DID, not what we hoped it would do.
 *
 *   2. Request-side prefix stability (`cache_prefix_break`) — a content hash of
 *      `messages[0]` observed on every `context` call. After #1016 the first
 *      message must stay byte-stable across a whole session; a logged CHANGE
 *      flags that something (pi-lens or otherwise) broke the cache prefix, which
 *      would silently invalidate the entire prompt-cache on every prefix-caching
 *      provider. Pure observation — it never alters context injection.
 *
 * Both paths are defensive: `usage` (and its fields) may be absent on older
 * hosts or non-assistant messages, so every access is guarded and the handlers
 * never throw — on error they `dbg(...)` and no-op, like the other index.ts
 * event handlers.

 * does NOT supply a stable id, all such sessions collapse onto `NO_SESSION_KEY`
 * and behave like the old single-var (a concurrent subagent could then still
 * cross-contaminate) — accepted as graceful degradation, not silently perfect.
