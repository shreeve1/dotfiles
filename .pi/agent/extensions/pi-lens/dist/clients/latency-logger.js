 * that ran as a starting point for root-causing a genuine block. Tracked before

/**
 * Phases excluded from `lastPhase` attribution alongside `loop_block`.
 * #1412 L3: `lsp_typescript_project_identity` is the classic-TS first-open
 * project-identity probe (tsserver-sync.ts) — a detached, best-effort
 * telemetry sample fired on every first didOpen, not genuine work. Letting it
 * win `lastPhase` would overwrite the real stall attribution for a
 * loop_block that happens to land right after a first open.
 * #1432 review: `advisory_provenance_decision`,
 * `authoritative_content_attachment_decision`, and
 * `agent_end_deferred_mutation_drain` are the same shape — zero-duration
 * decision telemetry, not genuine work — so they get the same exclusion.
 * `agent_end_deferred_mutation_requeue` (S2d gap 4's per-requeue record) and
 * `session_end_bus_rollup` (S2d gap 5's session-end rollup) are new
 * zero-duration siblings of the same shape, added alongside them.
 *
 * `lsp_aux_wait_outcome` (#1458) is DIFFERENT from every entry above: its
 * `durationMs` is a REAL bounded wait (the post-primary auxiliary grace, up
 * to a few seconds), not zero-duration decision telemetry. It is still
 * excluded because it is a WAIT-OUTCOME RECORD written after the aux wait
 * already completed, not the stall itself — that wait ran inside the
 * `lsp_touch_file`/diagnostics phase surrounding it, so letting this summary
 * row win `lastPhase` would misattribute a `loop_block` to the record instead
 * of to whatever phase is actually stalled when the block fires.
 * #1453: `tool_set_mutation` records an active-tool-set rewrite (zero-duration
 * bookkeeping, and it fires during session_start where a real stall must stay
 * attributed to the work around it), so it is excluded for the same reason.
 * #1467: `availability_decision` records a tool-probe verdict. Its `durationMs`
 * is the child's own probe time (often zero for a fast path or a cached
 * decision) and the record is bookkeeping ABOUT a probe, not host work — a
 * loop_block landing next to one must stay attributed to whatever really
 * stalled the loop, which is frequently the very thing that expired the probe.
 *
 * #1461 slice 1: `finding_dead_path_drop` is the same shape — the record a
 * delivery seam writes when it drops findings whose cited path no longer
 * exists.
