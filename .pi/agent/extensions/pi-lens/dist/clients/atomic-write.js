/**
 * Shared atomic tmp+rename file writer (closes #762).
 *
 * The `${target}.tmp-${process.pid}` + `renameSync` shape was independently
 * hand-rolled in five places (`instance-registry.ts`, `session-state-store.ts`,
 * `recent-touches.ts`, `review-graph/builder.ts`, `diagnostic-dispositions.ts`)
 * as each one picked up the need for a cross-process reader to never observe a
 * partially-written file: `rename()` replaces the destination atomically on
 * both POSIX and Windows (libuv uses `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`), so a
 * concurrent reader always sees either the fully-old or fully-new file, never
 * a torn write. Five independent copies of the same shape invite drift (e.g.
 * forgetting the tmp-file cleanup on the failure path) — this module is the
 * single implementation the rest re-use.
 *
 * Per-write-site error policy varies and is NOT a detail this helper should
 * paper over:
 *
 *   - `bestEffort: true` (the default, and the majority of today's sites): a
 *     write or rename failure just means this update is lost — swallow it,
 *     after a best-effort tmp-file cleanup. Appropriate for observability
 *     substrate (instance registry, recent-touches, review-graph cache,
 *     session widget state) where a dropped write is, at worst, a stale/
 *     missing sample.
 *   - `bestEffort: false`: rethrow the failure (after the same best-effort tmp
 *     cleanup). This is `clients/diagnostic-dispositions.ts`'s policy (#757):
 *     unlike the writers above, a disposition mark is functionally
 *     load-bearing — a silently lost mark is a correctness bug, not a dropped
 *     observability sample — so callers must see the failure rather than have
 *     it swallowed. See the #757 CHANGELOG entry for the full reasoning.
