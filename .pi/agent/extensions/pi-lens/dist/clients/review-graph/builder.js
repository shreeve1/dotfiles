// v3 (#260): test files are no longer indexed. Bumping the version makes
// loadPersistedGraph reject any v2 snapshot (which still contains test-file
// nodes/edges) → a clean tests-free rebuild on first load after upgrade, for
// every project, without anyone deleting the cache by hand.
// v4 (#655, narrow first slice): symbol-node IDs changed shape from
// `<file>:<name>` to `<file>:<name>:<kind>:<startLine>` (see symbol-id.ts) to
// stop overloads/same-named methods/nested functions from colliding onto one
// node. A v3 snapshot's nodes/edges still use the old ID shape throughout, so
// it must be rejected rather than merged with newly-built v4 IDs — same
// safe-rebuild mechanism as the v2→v3 bump above.
// v5 (#694): import resolution now prefers a `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` source
// twin over a compiled `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` sibling (jsTsCandidatePaths), and
// node creation is gated against untracked-AND-gitignored targets (see
// git-tracked-ignore.ts). A v4 snapshot from a compile-in-place project has
// cross-file import edges materialized on the compiled artifact nodes
// throughout (up to 100% of them, per #694's measurement) — merging that with
// newly-built v5 edges would leave the graph in mixed, partially-corrected
// state. Same safe-rebuild mechanism as the v2→v3/v3→v4 bumps above.
// v6 (#703): `getProjectIgnoreMatcher` is now tracked-aware — a TRACKED file
// that merely matches a `.gitignore`/global pattern (e.g.
// `clients/test-runner-client.ts` vs. `.gitignore`'s `test-*.ts`) is no
// longer dropped from the walk. A v5 snapshot built before this fix is
// missing those nodes entirely (never walked, never parsed) and instead has
// phantom compiled-artifact nodes standing in for them (0 symbols, importer
// edges materialized on the wrong node) — merging that with newly-walked v6
// nodes would leave the phantom AND the real node coexisting. Same
// safe-rebuild mechanism as the v2→v3/v3→v4/v4→v5 bumps above.
// v7 (#939): the canonical snapshot is streamed gzip. A v7 payload in the
// legacy uncompressed filename remains readable for one compatibility release.
// v8 (#1070): call/reference evidence now records call-like vs type-only
// references and tree-sitter query coverage, so call-graph consumers cannot
// mistake incomplete extraction for a clean zero.

 *
 * `getGraphBuildInfoForGraph` deliberately falls back to the global
 * `_lastGraphBuildInfo` slot on a WeakMap identity miss — fine for the telemetry
 * and `updateGraphBuildInfo` base-read callers, where a sibling build's `mode` is
 * only informational (and the first stamp of a graph legitimately bases off the
 * prior slot). But a gate that decides degraded-vs-clean must not read a DIFFERENT
 * graph's `mode: "cached"` (healthy) off that fallback, or it would mistake an
 * unstamped/rehydrated graph for a clean leaf and serve a silent all-clear (the
 * #533 false-clean trap). Such a caller reads THIS first and, when it returns
 * false, fails CLOSED (treats coverage as unknown/degraded) instead of trusting
 * the slot.
 *
 * Trustworthy iff EITHER the graph's own identity is present in the WeakMap (the
 * fallback is not even taken), OR nothing has been stamped since the last cache
 * clear (`_lastGraphBuildInfo` is still the pristine `mode: "full"` default, which
 * cannot be a sibling's real state). Only a miss AFTER some real build has stamped
 * — where the global slot could be a sibling's info — is untrustworthy.
 *
 * Live path: always trustworthy. Every `_doBuildGraph` return stamps the graph via
 * `setGraphBuildInfo` before returning it, so the cascade reads the freshly-stamped
 * same-identity instance (`has(graph)` true) and the miss branch is unreachable
 * today. This only hardens a future path that ever surfaces an unstamped graph.

//
// #1206: `cacheDir` is the SHARED project cache dir (getProjectDataDir/cache)
// that every durable store stages into via writeFileAtomic's generic
// `<target>.tmp-<pid>`. The old predicate also matched that shape, so this
// sweep deleted OTHER modules' in-flight staging files in the window between
// their write and their rename — turning their rename into ENOENT (propagated
// out of markDisposition for bestEffort:false stores) or silently dropping the
// update. The sweep is therefore scoped to artifacts the review graph itself
// produces, all of which are `<review-graph.*>.stage-<pid>-<gen>`:
//   review-graph.json.gz.stage-<pid>-<gen>              (persistGraph, L1861)
//   review-graph.checkpoint.json.gz.stage-<pid>-<gen>   (checkpoint, L2259)
//   ...plus either's worker tmp `<stage>.tmp-<pid>`, which still carries both
//   the `review-graph.` prefix and the `.stage-` marker.
// (LEGACY_GRAPH_CACHE_FILENAME, `review-graph.json`, is never staged — it is
// only ever `rmSync`'d as a one-time migration cleanup — so it is not a
// producer here despite matching the prefix.)
// The bare `.tmp-<pid>` shape is never matched, which also makes this sweep
// independent of any change to atomic-write's staging name (#1205). Dropping
// that shape means the review-graph sweep is no longer the incidental GC for
// other stores' orphaned atomic-write temps; the generic `.tmp-*` namespace is
// now swept at session_start by instance-reaper (#1228), not by this graph
// artifact-specific pass.
//
// Liveness: an entry whose embedded stage pid is still alive belongs to a
// concurrent healthy owner (or to us) and is skipped, reusing the reaper's
// conservative `realIsPidAlive` (ESRCH-only-means-dead) rather than inventing
// a second liveness probe. A recycled pid can therefore leave one stale stage
// file behind instead of destroying a live one — deliberately the safe
// direction; a later process whose pid table has moved on sweeps it.

// --- Cross-session resumable full build (checkpointing, #936 limit 2) ---
// A full build walks + tree-sitter-parses every source file, then resolves
// cross-file edges once at the end. On a large repo with short-lived sessions
// that whole pass can be killed before it finishes and, with no checkpoint,
// the next session starts from scratch — so it may NEVER complete. During the
// full-build extraction loop we periodically snapshot the PRE-resolution graph
// plus the exact set of files already folded into it (with content hashes) to
// a dedicated checkpoint file. A later session resumes from that snapshot,
// re-walking only files that changed/appeared since, and finishes the build.
//
// Correctness (equivalence to a cold full build) rests on one property of the
// extraction: `addFileToGraph`'s per-file contribution (the nodes it adds and
// the edges it adds, with their metadata) depends ONLY on that file's content
// and the cwd — never on other files or on processing order, because ALL
// cross-file linking is deferred to `resolveDeferredSymbolEdges`, run once
// after every file is in. So the pre-resolution graph is the order-independent
// union of per-file contributions (shared placeholder / imported-file stub
// nodes are created idempotently by id). Resuming therefore reconstructs the
// identical pre-resolution graph as long as the reused files' contributions
// are still current — which the content-hash + ignored-id + git gates below
// enforce, failing open to a cold build on any doubt.
