/**
 * Cross-platform CPU/RSS sampling (#620), used two ways:
 *
 * 1. **Long-lived processes** (this host process + the LSP children recorded
 *    in clients/instance-registry.ts): `sampleProcesses` takes a snapshot of
 *    a pid set at heartbeat cadence (clients/quiet-window.ts /
 *    clients/runtime-turn.ts already call `updateHeartbeat` at that cadence —
 *    this module doesn't own a timer of its own).
 * 2. **Transient analyzer children** (jscpd/knip/madge/gitleaks/etc., spawned
 *    via clients/safe-spawn.ts's `safeSpawnAsync`): `SpawnUsageSampler`
 *    brackets a single spawn with a short-interval poll (started right after
 *    `spawn()`, stopped at `child.on("close", ...)`), tracking peak/average
 *    CPU% and RSS for that one invocation.
 *
 * On **Linux/macOS** it uses `pidusage` (procfs on Linux, `ps` on macOS) — a
 * small pure-JS package (one transitive dep, `safe-buffer`) that bundles like
 * the repo's other pure-JS runtime deps (minimatch, js-yaml) rather than
 * needing an EXTERNAL entry in scripts/bundle-dist.mjs.
 *
 * On **Windows** it does NOT use `pidusage`: pidusage's Windows path shells out
 * to `gwmi` via an internal `spawn(..., { shell: "powershell.exe" })` that has
 * NO try/catch, and it runs that spawn from inside a ChildProcess `close`
 * callback (a detached async context). Under real Windows handle/commit
 * pressure that `spawn()` can throw `spawn UNKNOWN` (errno -4094)
 * **synchronously in that detached callback**, which no `try { await pidusage }
 * catch {}` at the call site can catch → uncaughtException → the pi host
 * crashes (#620, #533). pidusage 4.0.1 exposes no option to avoid the gwmi
 * path. So on Windows this module runs its OWN fully guarded
 * `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` query (see `sampleProcessesWindows`),
 * mirroring `findDescendantPidsWindows`'s guard pattern, and computes CPU%
 * from the same KernelModeTime/UserModeTime delta-over-elapsed formula gwmi
 * uses — so a spawn failure can only ever lose a data point, never throw.
 *
 * Every export here is best-effort: a sampling failure (pid already exited,
 * `pidusage` throwing, permission denied, etc.) must never throw into the
 * caller and must never block/slow the operation it's measuring — this
 * module only ever "loses a data point", matching the repo's existing
 * instrumentation-must-never-fail-the-operation-it-measures convention (see
 * clients/latency-logger.ts's fire-and-forget `logLatency` calls).
 *
 * The accumulation math (peak/average over a stream of samples) is split out
 * as a PURE class (`UsageAccumulator`) so it's unit-testable without any real
 * process/pidusage involvement — mirrors the pure/impure split in
 * clients/instance-reaper.ts (`decideOrphanReaping` vs `sweepOrphans`).

 * Resolving the live descendant tree (cmd.exe's children, and THEIR
