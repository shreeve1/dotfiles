/**
 * Production event-loop occupancy monitor (#192 Phase 2).
 *
 * pi-lens runs on pi's TUI event loop; a long synchronous block freezes
 * keystrokes. Our telemetry historically logged phase *durations*, which can't
 * distinguish a TUI-freezing synchronous burst from harmless async/subprocess
 * time — that blind spot let a ~1.5s enumeration freeze through (#188/#191).
 *
 * This wraps Node's native `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay()` — a histogram
 * of how late the loop services its own timer, i.e. how long it was blocked —
 * with **no per-event JS overhead**. `max` ≈ the worst synchronous block since
 * the last reset.
 *
 * ## System-stall contamination (#1122 / #1123)
 *
 * `monitorEventLoopDelay` measures timer lag with the monotonic clock
 * (`uv_hrtime`, backed by `QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows). When the whole
 * process is frozen or descheduled — machine sleep / Modern Standby, or paging
 * thrash under commit-charge exhaustion — its next timer fires late by the
 * *entire* wall-clock gap, and the histogram records that gap as a "block".
 * Two distinct system stalls were confirmed against the Windows System event
 * log: (1) a 290,179 ms block that lined up exactly with a 14:33:05Z→14:37:55Z
 * Modern Standby window (Kernel-Power 506/507), reported byte-identical by two
 * independent pids because the HDR histogram quantizes ~290 s into one bucket;
 * (2) a later silent host exit with zero sleep events but twelve
 * Resource-Exhaustion-Detector (id 2004) events at 97% commit charge — the
 * process was paging, not sleeping. Both are machine artifacts, not pi-lens
 * work; latency.log also held multi-*hour* "blocks" that can only be overnight
 * sleep.
 *
 * Comparing a wall clock to a monotonic clock does NOT catch these: on Windows
 * both advance across Modern Standby (the histogram's monotonic delta already
 * equalled the wall gap). The reliable discriminator is **CPU consumption**: a
 * genuine synchronous block of D ms burns ≈ D ms of main-thread CPU, so the
 * window that contains it must have consumed at least ~D ms of CPU. A frozen or
 * thrashing process consumes ~0 CPU across the gap, so when the worst block
 * exceeds all the CPU the window could account for, it was a stall, not work.
 * We window per turn (so the CPU accounting is bounded and each block is
 * attributable to its turn) and tag system-stall-suspected samples instead of
 * letting them poison the "worst real block" high-water.

 * A block is system-stall-suspected only when it is both (a) larger than any
 * plausible synchronous pi-lens stall (`floorMs`, default 20 s — the real tier
 * observed in latency.log tops out ~15 s) and (b) unaccounted for by the
 * window's CPU budget (`windowCpuMs + slopMs < maxMs`). The floor keeps a real
 * multi-second I/O-bound block (low CPU, but genuine) from being mislabeled,
 * while a frozen or paging process — ~0 CPU across a minutes-to-hours gap —
 * always trips. Sub-floor blocks are never auto-tagged, but the logged
 * `windowCpuMs`/`windowWallMs` still expose the CPU-vs-wall ratio so a reviewer
 * can spot a shorter paging stall by hand.
 *
 * KNOWN AMBIGUITY (honest, not fully resolvable from CPU alone): a genuine
 * pi-lens block that is BLOCKED IN A SYSCALL for >20 s — e.g. a `readdirSync` /
 * `statSync` stalled on a OneDrive/cloud-backed path fetching a dehydrated file,
 * or an antivirus-throttled read — also consumes ~0 CPU while wall time
 * advances, so it is CPU-indistinguishable from a suspend and WILL be tagged
 * `suspectSystemStall` and excluded from the health high-waters. That is the
 * conservative choice (a >20 s synchronous FS stall is itself a P0-worthy bug we
 * do NOT want silently counted as normal), and it is not silenced: such a sample
 * still re-logs every turn with its `lastPhase` attribution, which is the
 * forensic breadcrumb for exactly this class. Sharper corroboration (a magnitude
 * ceiling, a `maxMs`-vs-`windowWallMs` ratio) is tracked as a follow-up note on
 * #1123, not decided here.
