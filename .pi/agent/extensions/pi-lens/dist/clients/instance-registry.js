/**
 * Cross-process instance registry (#449 slice 1).
 *
 * Observability substrate for multi-agent LSP resource sharing. Records, in
 * a single machine-global file (`~/.pi-lens/instances.json`), every live
 * pi-lens process: its pid, project root, live LSP child servers, RSS, and a
 * heartbeat timestamp. Later slices (cross-process budget, same-root warm
 * attach) build on this; slice 1 is purely observational — it changes no
 * dispatch/LSP behavior, it only records state and reaps stale entries /
 * orphaned LSP children (#472).
 *
 * File shape: `{ instances: InstanceEntry[] }`. Missing or corrupt file is
 * treated as `{ instances: [] }` — this module must never throw on a read.
 *
 * Concurrency: every write is read-modify-write-whole-file with an atomic
 * tmp+rename (same pattern as clients/review-graph/builder.ts). Two
 * processes racing a write is a KNOWN, ACCEPTED race for slice 1
 * (last-writer-wins) — a lost update here only means a stale/missing
 * observability entry, never data corruption (the tmp+rename guarantees the
 * file itself is always valid JSON). A future slice can add file locking or
 * per-pid shard files if this proves too lossy in practice.

 * confirmed dead BEFORE aggregation — a hard-killed pi process otherwise
 * leaves a registry entry with heartbeat-cached RSS that reads as a live,

 * `STALE_HEARTBEAT_MS`, see clients/instance-reaper.ts). Dropped rather than
 * flagged `stale: true`: a dead pid is unambiguous (unlike heartbeat
 * staleness, which the reaper deliberately treats as "maybe idle-but-alive"
 * and never uses to justify removing/hiding anything) — the wire shape and
 * every existing caller (chiefly `pilens_health`'s headline instance
 * count/RSS/CPU numbers) simply expects a footprint of currently-live
 * instances. Left `undefined` for pure/synchronous callers (incl. every
 * pre-#735 unit test) that pass a plain snapshot with no intent to check OS
 * process state — no filtering happens, preserving prior behavior exactly.
 * No pid-reuse identity check is applied here (unlike the reaper's child-pid
 * `matchProcess`): `InstanceEntry` never recorded the host's own command
 * line to verify against (same gap #525 called out for the reaper's PARENT
 * pid, deliberately left unfixed there too), and a health-report false
 * positive is a much smaller blast radius than the reaper's mistaken kill —
 * so plain liveness is judged sufficient here.
