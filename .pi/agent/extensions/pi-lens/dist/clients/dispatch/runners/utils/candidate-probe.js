/**
 * Shared PATH-candidate availability sweep (#1476 Sonar follow-up, S3776).
 *
 * `go-client.ts` and `rust-client.ts` resolve their toolchain the same way:
 * walk a platform candidate list, treat a candidate with a path separator as
 * an existence check, and probe a bare command with a version flag on a
 * fixed host-side budget, classifying any failure through the shared policy
 * so a host stall cannot be mistaken for "the tool is not installed". The
 * migration to `availability-policy.ts` wrote that sweep out twice, and the
 * duplication was also what pushed both call sites over the Cognitive
 * Complexity limit. This is that sweep, written once.
