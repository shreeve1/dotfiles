/**
 * Build the turn-end `CascadeRun` for a neighbour whose diagnostics landed only
 * AFTER its cascade touch skipped the in-lane wait (#1023's `resolved-found`
 * quiet-window outcome; #1444 made native TS7 take that same path). Returns
 * `undefined` when there is nothing agent-facing to say — no ERROR-severity
 * diagnostics, or nothing the formatter renders.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inline in the quiet-window callback so the delivery
 * path (reconcile → run → turn_end) is testable end to end; index.ts only wires
 * it to `runtime.appendCascadeRun`.
