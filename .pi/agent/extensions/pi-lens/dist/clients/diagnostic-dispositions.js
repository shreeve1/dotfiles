/**
 * Agent+user disposition layer over dispatch diagnostics (#690, unifying #181/
 * #503/#504's discussion). Four dispositions:
 *
 *   false-positive — the rule misfired. Project-persistent, routed nowhere
 *                     special yet (telemetry hookup is a fast-follow).
 *   suppress       — real finding, deliberate policy not to fix. Persistent,
 *                     but the mechanism is an inline `pi-lens-ignore` comment
 *                     written into the source (see suppress-writer.ts), not
 *                     just a store entry — portable, git-visible, discoverable
 *                     without pi-lens's own store. The store entry here is an
 *                     audit-trail mirror, not the enforcement point.
 *   defer          — fix later, not now. Session-ephemeral: held in memory
 *                     only, so it naturally resurfaces on process restart —
 *                     never persisted, never needs pruning.
 *   flagged        — user wants the agent to fix this. Persistent until
 *                     resolved; surfaced through the existing lens_diagnostics
 *                     query (tagged), not a separate file/tool the agent has
 *                     to separately poll.
 *
 * Anchoring: TWO flavors, chosen per-disposition because each one binds to a
 * different thing conceptually:
 *
 *   STRICT ("dd:" prefix) — relativeFile|tool|rule|normalizedMessage|
 *     lineContentHash(diagnostic's own line). Used ONLY for false-positive: a
 *     false-positive judgment is about THIS specific piece of code — if the
 *     line is rewritten, the rule earned a fresh chance to fire on the new
 *     content, so the mark should NOT follow it. Reuses read-guard's
 *     lineContentHash so a no-op formatter/whitespace pass doesn't rot the
 *     anchor, while a semantic edit to the flagged line correctly invalidates
 *     it.
 *   WEAK ("ddw:" prefix) — relativeFile|tool|rule|normalizedMessage, no line
 *     hash at all. Used for defer, flagged, and suppress: these are
 *     intent-level judgments ("I'll get to this", "fix this", "policy says
 *     don't") about a finding identity, not about one exact line's bytes —
 *     they must survive incidental edits elsewhere on the flagged line
 *     (reformatting, a nearby rename) without silently dropping the mark.
 *     suppress's real enforcement is the inline comment (see
 *     suppress-writer.ts) which travels with the code by construction; the
 *     weak-anchored store entry is just an audit mirror plus a second,
 *     belt-and-braces filter.
 *
 * Distinct prefixes ("dd:" vs "ddw:") keep the two id spaces from ever
 * colliding in the same store.
 *
 * Content is hashed only from the diagnostic's own line (for the strict
 * anchor), not a surrounding window as #181's original sketch considered.
 * Two diagnostics on the same file/tool/rule/message whose flagged line
 * happens to have identical content collide on the SAME strict anchor —
 * deliberately: identical content at the same rule/message is a semantically
 * equivalent finding, so marking one intentionally marks all of them (e.g. a
 * copy-pasted line repeated a few times in the same file). If that
 * assumption proves wrong in practice, a surrounding-window hash can be
 * layered on later without changing the store shape.
