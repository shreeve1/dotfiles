/**
 * Orphaned LSP process reaper (#472), built on the instance registry (#449
 * slice 1).
 *
 * Split into a PURE decision function (`decideOrphanReaping`) and an IMPURE
 * sweep (`sweepOrphans`) so the decision logic is unit-testable with fake
 * pid tables — no real process spawns/kills in tests.
 *
 * Why the registry reaper, not EOF/processId alone (see issue #472): both are
 * best-effort hints a well-behaved server may honor (typescript-language-server
 * does; ast-grep's native exe does not — an upstream LSP-spec violation). The
 * registry reaper works regardless of why a stdin pipe write-end stayed open
 * after the parent died (Windows handle-inheritance capture) — it identifies
 * dead-parent instances directly and kills the full recorded child tree, with
 * a command-line marker fallback for the case where the pid itself was
 * recycled or the mid-tree pid link is broken (e.g. a dead node-wrapper whose
 * native-exe grandchild is still alive under a different, unrecorded pid).
 *
 * #525 root cause: a parent instance was ONLY ever considered dead via
 * `isPidAlive(instance.pid)` — a raw `process.kill(pid, 0)` check. Unlike
 * child pids (which get a command-line/marker identity check via
 * `matchProcess` to guard against a recycled pid), the PARENT pid had no
 * identity verification at all, because `InstanceEntry` never recorded the
 * parent's own command line. Windows recycles pids far more aggressively than
 * POSIX (no zombie/wait-reaping semantics holding a dead pid "reserved"), so
 * over a long enough window (observed: ~13h) a dead parent's pid is very
 * plausibly reassigned to a live, unrelated process — `isPidAlive` then
 * (correctly, per its own conservative contract) reports "alive", and the
 * stale instance is never reaped, no matter how old its heartbeat is.
 *
 * The #525 fix is deliberately ASYMMETRIC by consequence:
 *
 * - **Heartbeat staleness (`STALE_HEARTBEAT_MS`) cleans REGISTRY ENTRIES,
 *   never kills.** A stale-heartbeat-but-pid-alive instance goes into
 *   `staleInstances` (entry dropped from instances.json) with ZERO process
 *   kills and its children still marker-protected. Why: the heartbeat call
 *   sites are runtime-turn.ts (per turn end) and quiet-window.ts (per run
 *   settle) ONLY — no timer exists. A pi session left OPEN but UNUSED
 *   overnight fires neither, so its heartbeat legitimately goes >6h stale
 *   while the session and its warm LSP fleet are genuinely alive. Killing on
 *   staleness would take that fleet down under the idle session — and
 *   `matchProcess` would NOT save it (its children really ARE that
 *   instance's LSP servers; identity verification guards against pid reuse,
 *   not against misclassifying a live parent). Removing just the entry is
 *   safe: the idle session's next turn re-registers via `registerInstance`.
 * - **Process kills require a pid-confirmed-DEAD parent** (`deadInstances`),
 *   exactly as before #525. Only then are its children classified for
 *   kill/marker-search.
 *
 * This still fixes both observed #525 cases: the 13h-stale test-fixture
 * entry AND the recycled-parent-pid case (a dead parent whose pid now
 * belongs to an unrelated live process — `isPidAlive` lies, but the stale
 * heartbeat gets the ENTRY dropped, which is all the pollution fix needs).
 */
/**
 * A pid-ALIVE instance whose heartbeat is older than this gets its registry
 * ENTRY removed — it is NEVER kill-eligible on staleness alone (see the
 * module docstring's asymmetry note: an overnight-idle-but-alive session
 * legitimately exceeds this threshold because heartbeats only fire at turn
 * end / run settle, so staleness must clean records, not kill processes).
 * 6 hours comfortably catches the observed 13h-stale pollution case.

 * Fire-and-forget REGISTRY-INDEPENDENT backstop sweep (#658): finds
 * pi-lens-managed LSP/scanner processes the registry-driven `sweepOrphans`
 * can never see again once their registry trace is lost (a stale-heartbeat
 * entry removal, or a `killPidTree` call that failed silently) — enumerates
 * live OS processes by known binary name, and kills any that are both
 * untracked and have a confirmed-dead parent. A strictly ADDITIVE second
 * layer: `sweepOrphans`'s registry-driven path is untouched and remains the
 * cheap, correct common case.
 *
 * Kill-attempt retry: deliberately NO separate retry-tracking state. If
 * `killPidTree` fails silently, the process stays alive, untracked, and its
 * parent stays dead — so it stays classified as backstop-kill-eligible and
 * this exact sweep simply tries again at the next `session_start`, with zero
 * extra bookkeeping. This only breaks if the orphan's *parent* pid gets
 * reused by a live process in the interim (closes the window), which is the
 * same residual risk `decideOrphanReaping`'s registry path already accepts.
 * A future hardening (making `killPidTree` return a success signal so a
 * failed kill can be logged distinctly from "already gone") is a reasonable
 * follow-up, not required for correctness here.
 *
 * Never throws — every step is wrapped so a reap failure cannot block or
 * crash the caller (session_start).
