/**
 * skill-loader.ts — Preload named skills.
 *
 * Roots, in precedence order:
 *   - <cwd>/.pi/skills           (project, Pi's standard)
 *   - <cwd>/.agents/skills       (project, cross-tool Agent Skills spec — https://agentskills.io)
 *   - getAgentDir()/skills       (user, default ~/.pi/agent/skills — Pi's standard)
 *   - ~/.agents/skills           (user, cross-tool Agent Skills spec)
 *   - ~/.pi/skills               (legacy global, pre-Pi)
 *
 * Layout per root:
 *   - <root>/<name>.md            (flat file at the top level)
 *   - <root>/.../<name>/SKILL.md  (directory skill, may be nested — Pi's standard)
 *
 * Recursion skips dotfile entries and node_modules. A directory that itself contains
 * SKILL.md is a skill — we don't descend into it (Pi: skills don't nest).
 *
 * Symlinks are rejected for security (deviation from Pi, which follows them).
