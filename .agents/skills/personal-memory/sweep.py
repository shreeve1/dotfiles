"""Retention sweep for the work folders no other rule prunes.

Lists files past their age limit; --apply deletes them and any folder that deletion left empty.
A file under `artifacts/` is kept while a note, skill or context file names it or its topic folder.
`reports/`, `memory/` and `clients/` are never touched here: memory has its own rules (gate.py).
Only a file whose bytes equal the committed copy is deleted, so every deletion can be undone.
Any doubt (not a git repo, a nested root, an unreadable folder) deletes nothing.
