# Utilities

This is a Codex-native port of an upstream PAI skill. Codex instructions, local tools, and higher-priority AGENTS.md guidance take precedence.

Use local Codex skills, shell tools, subagents, and web access only when the current session permits them. Do not assume external providers are configured.

## Gated Dependencies

- Browser automation runtime
- Cloudflare API credentials
- External media processing tools
- Fabric CLI and patterns

## Ported Workflow

# Utilities

Unified skill for developer utility and tooling workflows.
