# AnnualReports

This is a Codex-native port of an upstream PAI skill. Codex instructions, local tools, and higher-priority AGENTS.md guidance take precedence.

Use local Codex skills, shell tools, subagents, and web access only when the current session permits them. Do not assume external providers are configured.

## Gated Dependencies

- External media processing tools

## Ported Workflow

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`.codex/pai/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/AnnualReports/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.
