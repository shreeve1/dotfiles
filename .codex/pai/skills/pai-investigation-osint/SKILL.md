# OSINT

This is a Codex-native port of an upstream PAI skill. Codex instructions, local tools, and higher-priority AGENTS.md guidance take precedence.

Use local Codex skills, shell tools, subagents, and web access only when the current session permits them. Do not assume external providers are configured.

## Gated Dependencies

- External media processing tools
- Gemini CLI or API access
- Grok API access
- Perplexity API access

## Ported Workflow

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`.codex/pai/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/OSINT/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


# OSINT Skill

Open Source Intelligence gathering for authorized investigations.

## Trigger Patterns

**People OSINT:**
- "do OSINT on [person]", "research [person]", "background check on [person]"
- "who is [person]", "find info about [person]", "investigate this person"
-> Route to `Workflows/PeopleLookup.md`

**Company OSINT:**
- "do OSINT on [company]", "research [company]", "company intelligence"
- "what can you find about [company]", "investigate [company]"
-> Route to `Workflows/CompanyLookup.md`

**Investment Due Diligence:**
- "due diligence on [company]", "vet [company]", "is [company] legitimate"
- "assess [company]", "should we work with [company]"
-> Route to `Workflows/CompanyDueDiligence.md`

**Entity/Threat Intel:**
- "investigate [entity]", "threat intelligence on [entity]", "is this malicious"
- "research this threat actor", "analyze [entity]", "check this IP"
-> Route to `Workflows/EntityLookup.md`

**Domain/Subdomain Investigation:**
- "investigate domain", "check domain", "subdomain enumeration"
- "domain recon on [domain]", "what subdomains does [domain] have"
- "DNS investigation", "certificate transparency for [domain]"
-> Route to `Workflows/DomainLookup.md`

**Organization/NGO/Government:**
- "research organization", "investigate NGO", "research agency"
- "who is [organization]", "investigate [nonprofit]", "research [government agency]"
- "what do we know about [association]", "background on [institution]"
-> Route to `Workflows/OrganizationLookup.md`

## Authorization (REQUIRED)

**Before ANY investigation, verify:**
- [ ] Explicit authorization from client
- [ ] Clear scope definition
- [ ] Legal compliance confirmed
- [ ] Documentation in place

**STOP if any checkbox is unchecked.** See `EthicalFramework.md` for details.

## Resource Index

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SOURCES.JSON` | Master catalog of 279 OSINT sources across 8 categories |
| `SOURCES.md` | Human-readable source reference with descriptions and access info |
| `EthicalFramework.md` | Authorization, legal, ethical boundaries |
| `Methodology.md` | Collection methods, verification, reporting |
| `PeopleTools.md` | People search, social media, public records (legacy - use SOURCES.JSON) |
| `CompanyTools.md` | Business databases, DNS, tech profiling (legacy - use SOURCES.JSON) |
| `EntityTools.md` | Threat intel, scanning, malware analysis (legacy - use SOURCES.JSON) |

## Integration

**Automatic skill invocations:**
- **Research Skill** - Parallel researcher agent deployment (REQUIRED)
- **Recon Skill** - Technical infrastructure reconnaissance

**Agent fleet patterns:**
- Quick lookup: 4-6 agents
- Standard investigation: 8-16 agents
- Comprehensive due diligence: 24-32 agents

**Researcher types:**
| Researcher | Best For |
|------------|----------|
| PerplexityResearcher | Current web data, social media, company updates |
| ClaudeResearcher | Academic depth, professional backgrounds |
| GeminiResearcher | Multi-perspective, cross-domain connections |
| GrokResearcher | Contrarian analysis, fact-checking |

## File Organization

**Active investigations:**
```
.codex/pai/MEMORY/WORK/$(jq -r '.work_dir' .codex/pai/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json)/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_osint-[target]/
```

**Archived reports:**
```
.codex/pai/History/research/YYYY-MM/[target]-osint/
```

---

## Ethical Guardrails

**ALLOWED:** Public sources only - websites, social media, public records, search engines, archived content

**PROHIBITED:** Private data, unauthorized access, social engineering, purchasing breached data, ToS violations

See `EthicalFramework.md` for complete requirements.
