# Research

This is a Codex-native port of an upstream PAI skill. Codex instructions, local tools, and higher-priority AGENTS.md guidance take precedence.

Use local Codex skills, shell tools, subagents, and web access only when the current session permits them. Do not assume external providers are configured.

## Gated Dependencies

- Apify account, token, and MCP or CLI access
- Bright Data account and MCP access
- Browser automation runtime
- External media processing tools
- Fabric CLI and patterns
- Gemini CLI or API access
- Perplexity API access

## Ported Workflow

##  important TRIGGER

**When user says "research" (in any form), usually invoke this skill.**

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "research" / "do research" / "research this" | -> Standard mode (3 agents) |
| "quick research" / "minor research" | -> Quick mode (1 agent) |
| "extensive research" / "deep research" | -> Extensive mode (12 agents) |
| "deep investigation" / "investigate [topic]" / "map the [X] landscape" | -> Deep Investigation (iterative) |

**"Research" alone = Standard mode. when appropriate.**

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`.codex/pai/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Research/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


# Research Skill

Comprehensive research, analysis, and content extraction system.

## important: URL Verification

**READ:** `UrlVerificationProtocol.md` - Every URL must be verified before delivery.

Research agents hallucinate URLs. A single broken link is a catastrophic failure.

## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

**CRITICAL:** For due diligence, company/person background checks, or vetting -> **INVOKE OSINT SKILL INSTEAD**

### Research Modes (Primary Workflows)
- Quick/minor research (1 Perplexity, 1 query) -> `Workflows/QuickResearch.md`
- Standard research - DEFAULT (3 agents: Perplexity + Codex + Gemini) -> `Workflows/StandardResearch.md`
- Extensive research (4 types x 3 threads = 12 agents) -> `Workflows/ExtensiveResearch.md`
- Deep investigation / iterative research (progressive deepening, loop-compatible) -> `Workflows/DeepInvestigation.md`

### Deep Content Analysis
- Extract alpha / deep analysis / highest-alpha insights -> `Workflows/ExtractAlpha.md`

### Content Retrieval
- Difficulty accessing content (CAPTCHA, bot detection, blocking) -> `Workflows/Retrieve.md`
- YouTube URL extraction (use `fabric -y URL` immediately) -> `Workflows/YoutubeExtraction.md`
- Web scraping -> `Workflows/WebScraping.md`

### Specific Research Types
- Codex web search only (free, no API keys) -> `Workflows/ClaudeResearch.md`
- Perplexity API research (use Quick for single-agent) -> `Workflows/QuickResearch.md`
- Interview preparation (Tyler Cowen style) -> `Workflows/InterviewResearch.md`
- AI trends analysis -> `Workflows/AnalyzeAiTrends.md`

### Fabric Pattern Processing
- Use Fabric patterns (242+ specialized prompts) -> `Workflows/Fabric.md`

### Content Enhancement
- Enhance/improve content -> `Workflows/Enhance.md`
- Extract knowledge from content -> `Workflows/ExtractKnowledge.md`

## Quick Reference

**READ:** `QuickReference.md` for detailed examples and mode comparison.

| Trigger | Mode | Speed |
|---------|------|-------|
| "quick research" | 1 Perplexity agent | ~10-15s |
| "do research" | 3 agents (default) | ~15-30s |
| "extensive research" | 12 agents | ~60-90s |
| "deep investigation" | Progressive iteration | ~3-60min |

---

## Integration

### Feeds Into
- **blogging** - Research for blog posts
- **newsletter** - Research for newsletters
- **xpost** - Create posts from research

### Uses
- **be-creative** - deep thinking for extract alpha
- **OSINT** - important for company/people comprehensive research
- **BrightData MCP** - CAPTCHA solving, advanced scraping
- **Apify MCP** - RAG browser, specialized site scrapers

## Deep Investigation Mode

**Progressive iterative research** that builds a persistent knowledge vault. Works in both single-run (one cycle) and loop mode (Algorithm-driven iterations).

**Concept:** Broad landscape -> discover entities -> score importance/effort -> deep-dive one at a time -> loop until coverage complete.

**Domain template packs** customize the investigation for specific domains:
- `Templates/MarketResearch.md` - Companies, Products, People, Technologies, Trends, Investors
- `Templates/ThreatLandscape.md` - Threat Actors, Campaigns, TTPs, Vulnerabilities, Tools, Defenders
- No template? The workflow creates entity categories dynamically from the landscape research.

**Example invocation:**
```
"Do a deep investigation of the AI agent market"
-> Loads MarketResearch.md template
-> Iteration 1: Broad landscape + first entity deep-dive
-> Loop mode: Each iteration deep-dives the next highest-priority entity
-> Exit: When all CRITICAL/HIGH entities researched + all categories covered
```

**Artifacts persist** at `.codex/pai/MEMORY/RESEARCH/{date}_{topic}/` - the vault survives across sessions.

See `Workflows/DeepInvestigation.md` for full workflow details.

## File Organization

**Working files (temporary work artifacts):** `.codex/pai/MEMORY/WORK/{current_work}/`
- Read `.codex/pai/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json` to get the `work_dir` value
- All iterative work artifacts go in the current work item directory
- This ties research artifacts to the work item for learning and context

**History (permanent):** `.codex/pai/History/research/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_[topic]/`
