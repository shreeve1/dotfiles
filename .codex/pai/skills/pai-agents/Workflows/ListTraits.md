### Step 3: Explain Composition System

Add context for user:

```
You can combine these traits to create custom agents:

EXPERTISE + PERSONALITY + APPROACH = Custom Agent

Examples:
- "Create a security expert who's skeptical and thorough"
  -> security + skeptical + thorough

- "I need someone with legal knowledge who's really careful"
  -> legal + cautious + meticulous

- "Get me a creative thinker who works fast"
  -> creative + enthusiastic + rapid

Just describe what you need naturally, and I'll compose the right agent.

## Example Interaction

**User:** "What kinds of agents can you create?"

**System:**
```
I can compose agents from 28 traits across three categories:

EXPERTISE (what they know):
security, legal, finance, medical, technical, research, creative,
business, data, communications

PERSONALITY (how they think):
skeptical, enthusiastic, cautious, bold, analytical, creative,
empathetic, contrarian, pragmatic, meticulous

APPROACH (how they work):
thorough, rapid, systematic, exploratory, comparative, synthesizing,
adversarial, consultative

Just tell me what you need:
- "I need a legal expert who's really thorough"
- "Create a skeptical security analyst"
- "Get me someone creative and fast"

```
