## 2026-06-04 session-update | RPIV pipeline driver and companion skills

- Actor: Claude Code
- Inputs: current session on the `rpiv-run` pipeline; `bin/rpiv-run`, `.claude/skills/rpiv-monitor/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/gap-sweep/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/rpiv-merge/SKILL.md`; commits `bfaafaa`, `794a79c`, `edcd3c5`
- Outputs: `wiki/raw/sessions/2026-06-04-rpiv-pipeline-skills.md`, `wiki/candidates/analysis-session-rpiv-pipeline.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/ROUTING.md`, `wiki/CLAIMS.md`, `wiki/log.md`
- Notes: Captured the RPIV pipeline architecture (default engine, fresh `rpiv/<TS>` branch not a worktree, file-based cross-engine handoff, `.rpiv/run/<TS>/.base` base-ref persistence) and the three companion skills as a curated raw session note plus one candidate analysis page; added a non-authoritative "RPIV Pipeline Automation" routing section; recorded claims C-0106 through C-0115 (C-0115 marked medium confidence as not yet exercised end-to-end). Excluded the downstream cleon-ui-pi feature merge and pm2 restart as non-durable.

## 2026-06-04 promote | RPIV Pipeline Driver And Companion Skills

- Actor: Claude Code
- Inputs: `wiki/candidates/analysis-session-rpiv-pipeline.md`
- Outputs: `wiki/analyses/rpiv-pipeline.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/ROUTING.md`, `wiki/CLAIMS.md`, `wiki/log.md`
- Notes: Promoted the RPIV pipeline analysis candidate into `wiki/analyses/` (status: promoted). Moved the index row from the candidate review queue to the Analyses section, marked the RPIV Pipeline Automation route as promoted/authoritative, and repointed claims C-0106 through C-0115 to the promoted page path. Candidate file removed after the target was verified.

## 2026-06-20 cleanup | Remove retired-system wiki references

- Actor: Pi
- Inputs: James request to remove confusing retired-system references from all local wikis.
- Outputs: pruned retired-system source/candidate pages from this wiki; refreshed `wiki/README.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/ROUTING.md`, `wiki/CLAIMS.md`, and `wiki/log.md`.
- Notes: Kept only non-retired-system OpenCode subagent and RPIV pipeline wiki knowledge.
