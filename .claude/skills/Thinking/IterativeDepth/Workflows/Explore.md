# Explore Workflow — Iterative Depth

## Purpose

Run N structured exploration passes over the same problem, each from a different lens, to extract richer ISC criteria than single-pass analysis produces.

## Invocation

This workflow is invoked:
1. **Directly** by the user: "use iterative depth on this problem"
2. **By the Algorithm** during OBSERVE phase when the Capability Audit selects IterativeDepth
3. **By other skills** that need enhanced requirement extraction

## Inputs

- **Problem/Request:** The original user request or problem statement
- **Context:** Any available context (conversation history, codebase state, prior work)
- **Depth:** Determined by SLA or explicit user request

## Execution

### Step 1: Determine Depth

```
IF SLA = Instant → SKIP (return immediately, no iterative depth)
IF SLA = Fast → N = 2 (Literal + Failure)
IF SLA = Standard → N = 4 (Literal + Stakeholder + Failure + Experiential)
IF SLA = Deep → N = 8 (All lenses)
IF user specifies a number → N = that number (2-8)
```

### Step 2: Load Lenses

Read `TheLenses.md` for the lens definitions being used this run.

For domain-specific tasks, the ordering may be overridden:
- Security tasks: Failure, Stakeholder, Temporal, Constraint Inversion
- UX tasks: Experiential, Stakeholder, Literal, Analogical
- Architecture tasks: Temporal, Constraint Inversion, Analogical, Meta
- Ambiguous requests: Meta, Stakeholder, Literal, Failure

### Step 3: Execute Passes

**For each lens (1 through N):**

```

│ + A{N}: [new anti-criterion]                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Execution modes by SLA:**

- **Fast (2 lenses):** Run both lenses inline as structured thought. No agents spawned. Output directly into the Algorithm's OBSERVE phase.

- **Standard (4 lenses):** Run lenses 1-2 inline, then spawn 2 background agents for lenses 3-4 in parallel. Merge results.

- **Deep (8 lenses):** Spawn 4 pairs of background agents (or 8 individual agents) for maximum parallelization. Each agent gets:
  - The original problem/request
  - Their assigned lens definition
  - Current ISC criteria so far (from earlier lenses)
  - Instruction: "Return 2-5 new ISC criteria or refinements from this lens"
  - SLA: "Complete within 30 seconds"

### Step 4: Synthesize

After all passes complete:

1. **Deduplicate:** Remove criteria that are semantically identical across lenses
2. **Merge refinements:** If multiple lenses refined the same criterion, take the most specific version
3. **Prioritize:** Order criteria by how many lenses surfaced them (consensus = high priority)
4. **Format:** Output all new/refined criteria in ISC format (8-12 words, state not action, binary testable)

### Step 5: Integrate

Return the enriched criteria to the calling context:
- If called from Algorithm OBSERVE: feed directly into the calling ISA/todo criteria set
- If called standalone: Present the enriched criteria set to the user

## Output Format

```
🔍 ITERATIVE DEPTH COMPLETE ({N} lenses applied)

📊 Coverage:
- Lenses used: {list of lens names}
- New criteria discovered: {count}
- Existing criteria refined: {count}
- Anti-criteria discovered: {count}

📋 NEW ISC CRITERIA:
[List each new criterion, prefixed "ISC-"]

📋 REFINED ISC CRITERIA:
[List each refined criterion with evidence of what changed]

📋 NEW ANTI-CRITERIA:
[List each new anti-criterion, prefixed "ISC-A"]

## Agent Prompt Template (for Deep SLA)

When spawning agents for individual lenses:

```
CONTEXT: You are performing Iterative Depth analysis — examining a problem from a specific structured angle to discover requirements that other angles miss.

PROBLEM: {original user request / problem statement}

YOUR LENS: {lens name} — {lens description}
YOUR QUESTION: {lens core question}

CURRENT ISC (from prior lenses):
{list of criteria already discovered}

TASK: Explore this problem EXCLUSIVELY through your assigned lens. Do NOT repeat criteria already found. Find what only YOUR lens can see.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- 2-5 new ISC criteria (8-12 words each, state not action, binary testable)
- 0-3 refinements to existing criteria (what changed and why)
- 0-2 anti-criteria (what must NOT happen)

SLA: Complete within 30 seconds.
```

## Integration with Algorithm OBSERVE Phase

When the Capability Audit selects IterativeDepth (#4 Skills match), it runs AFTER the initial Reverse Engineering block but BEFORE ISC CREATION. The flow becomes:

```
OBSERVE Phase:
1. Reverse Engineering (standard — what they said/implied/don't want)
2. Capability Audit (standard — 20/20 scan)
3. >>> ITERATIVE DEPTH (if selected) <<<
   - Takes Reverse Engineering output as input
   - Runs N lenses over it
   - Produces enriched requirement understanding
4. ISC CREATION (now informed by iterative depth findings)
5. ISC Quality Gate (standard)
```

This means ISC criteria benefit from multi-angle exploration BEFORE they're created, rather than being corrected after the fact.
