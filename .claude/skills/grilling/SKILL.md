description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases.

Interview me to reach a shared understanding of this plan — but apply the 80/20 rule. Spend your questions on the vital few decisions that determine most of the outcome: the ones that are hard to reverse, that other decisions hang off of, or where getting it wrong is expensive. Skip the trivial many.

Before each question, ask yourself: "Does this decision meaningfully change the plan, or am I just walking a branch for completeness?" If the branch is low-stakes, easily reversible, or has an obvious default, state your recommended default in one line and move on — do not turn it into a question. Prune branches that don't change what we build.

Resolve dependencies in order — settle a foundational decision before the ones that depend on it — but only descend into a sub-branch when the answer would actually shift the design. For each real question, provide your recommended answer.

Each question should be formatted like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it — don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report — ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's — put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
